# Python 3.5.2 IDLE x86/32-bit
# Author: Tyler Corum, 10/11/2016
# Purpose: A group of people were presented the following problem to solve.  I have done just that and I am building the program in Python to demonstrate it to you.  This is a great learning experience for me, and I am pround to have presented it to the class as well.  I had found the solution in relatively less steps than others.  Even the website I found the problem had it solved in more steps than what I was able to solve it in.  http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/puzzles/25-horses-3-fastest-5-races-puzzle/  I hope you enjoy!

# 1. Introduction to the problem
# ------------------------------
# 	Outline:  Letâ€™s say that you have 25 horses, and you want to pick the fastest 3 
#	horses out of those 25. In each race, only 5 horses can run at the same time because 
# 	there are only 5 tracks. What is the minimum number of races required to find the 3 
# 	fastest horses without using a stopwatch?
#
#	My solution:  Race 5 horses.  Once the top fastest horse of that race crosses the
# 	finish line, create a photo finish of the position of the 4 other horses relative
# 	to the fastest.  We can use the fastest as a point of relativity for the rest of
# 	the 20 horses by racing 4 new horses with it.  If the horse still wins, the relative
#	position of all horses remains the same, but if he doesn't come in first, it means
# 	that all prior racers need to be adjusted relative to the fastest's new relative
# 	position.
#
#	Illustration: horse1 comes in first, his relative position to the other horses is
#	1.000  Lets say the rest of the horses only reached 50% of the way complete when
#   horse1 finished.  This means they are 0.500.  Let's say he races 4 new horses, and 
#   a new leader emerges.  The newLeader is now 1, and with examining the second race's photo finish, you
#	determine horse1 only made it 50% of the way by the time the second race's winner
# 	passed the finish line.  This means horse2, horse3, horse4, and horse5 now are a
#	further 50% relative to the newLeader's distance.
#	
#	First Race:
#	|===============================horses2-5|==================================horse1|
#	|==============================horses2-5|=================================horse1|
#	|=============================horses2-5|================================horse1|
#	|============================horses2-5|===============================horse1|
#	|===========================horses2-5|===========================horse1|
#	|=========================horses2-5|========================horse1|
#	|=======================horses2-5|=====================horse1|
#	|====================horses2-5|===================horse1|
#	|================horses2-5|===================horse1|
# 	Second Race: =horses2-5|================horse1|
# 	|===========horses2-5|============horses1|===============================newLeader|
# 	
# 	...and so on, shifting their relative distance ran to the current-fastest horse.  
#	The minimum amount of races to complete this problem is 6.  Now I'm going to code
#	it in Python.
